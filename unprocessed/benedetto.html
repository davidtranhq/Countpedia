                    <p>Illegitimate son of <a href=madame_danglars.html>Madame Danglars</a> and <a href=gerard_villefort.html>Gérard de Villefort</a>. He was almost buried alive by his father in the garden of <a href=renee.html>his father's wife's (Renée de Saint-Méran)</a> family estate. <a href=bertuccio.html>Bertuccio</a>, enemy of Monsieur Villefort, saw him burying the box and stabbed him. Believing there to be treasure inside, Bertuccio stole the box. Upon seeing a baby inside, he took the baby to his sister-in-law. Benedetto lived with Bertuccio's sister-in-law and terrorised her. One day, he tied her up, tortured her, and stole her money.</p>
                    <p>He wound up in prison with <a href=caderousse.html>Gaspard Caderousse</a> as a cellmate. The <a href=edmond.html>Count of Monte Cristo</a> bailed them both out and paid Benedetto to disguise himself as a wealthy Italian nobleman. He betrayed and killed Caderousse during an attempted robbery at the Count's house. He was engaged to <a href=eugenie_danglars.html>Eugénie Danglars</a> before the Count exposed him for his crimes and he was sent back to jail.</p>
