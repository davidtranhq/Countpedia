                    <p>One of the people, along with <a href=baron_danglars.html>Danglars</a> and <a href=fernand.html>Fernand Mondego</a> who accused <a href=edmond.html>Edmond Dantès</a> of treason. Later, he became a poor innkeeper. <a href=edmond.html>Abbé Busoni</a> came to visit Caderousse at his inn and learned of the story of his imprisonment and of how the lives of his friends have progressed while he was imprisoned. Abbé Busoni rewards Caderousse for his honesty with a diamond worth 50 000 francs.</p>
                    <p>Despite Abbé Busoni's generosity, Caderousse's greed drives him to continue to rob and murder. One night, his accomplice <a href=bendetto.html>Benedetto</a> suggests he tries to rob the <a href=edmond.html>Count of Monte Cristo</a>. He fails and Benedetto betrays him and murders him.</p>
