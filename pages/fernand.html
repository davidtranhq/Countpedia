                    <p>He was a poor Catalan fisherman in his youth. He was in love with <a href=mercedes.html>Mercédès</a>, <a href=edmond.html>Edmond Dantès</a>' fiancée. He mailed the letter accusing Edmond of treason to <a href=gerard_villefort.html>Monsieur de Villefort</a> which led to Edmond's arrest.</p>
                    <p>A few days before the second Restoration, he took part in the battle of Ligny. The night of the battle, he acquantinced with a general who was in secret contact with the enemy. The general persuaded Fernand to accompany him and join the English. Upon return to France, Fernand was made a lieutenant and became a captain by the time the war with France began. Successive military achievements, with the help of <a href=baron_danglars.html>Danglars</a>, who lived in Spain at the time, gave him the promotion to colonel, after which he was named the Count de Morcerf.

                    <p>He served in Greece under Ali Pasha, who rewarded Fernand by bequeathing him a large fortune. He betrayed Ali Pasha and sold his daughter into slavery. With his new fortune, he settled in Paris and married Mercédès, with whom he had a <a href=albert.html>child</a>. His downfall begins when the <a href=edmond.html>Count of Monte Cristo</a> reveals Fernand's trecheraous acts against France and Ali Pasha to the press. When he discovers his wife and son have abandoned him, he shoots himself.
