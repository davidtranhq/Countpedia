                    <p>Servant of the <a href=edmond.html>Count of Monte Cristo</a>. During the war, Bertuccio's brother was murdered. He requested that <a href=gerard_villefort.html>Gérard de Villefort</a>, the public prosecutor, punish the murderer. Having no respect for Bertuccio's Corsican heritage, Villefort  declined Bertuccio's request, causing Bertuccio to swear a vendetta against him. </p>
                    <p>Later, Bertuccio traced him to the estate of the Saint-Mérans, where he found him trying to bury a box. Believing it to be treasure, he stabbed Villefort and stole the box. Upon opening the box and discovering Villefort's baby inside of it, he took the child to be raised by his sister-in-law. The child was named <a href=benedetto.html>Benedetto.</a></p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 50px">Some time later, Bertuccio was involved with a group of smugglers who were caught docking in Marseilles. Bertuccio fled the scene and sought refuge at <a href=caderousse.html>Caderousse</a>'s inn. During his stay, he overhears the <a href=edmond.html>Abbé Busoni</a> giving Caderousse a diamond. He overhears Caderousse selling the diamond to a merchant, killing the merchant, stealing back the diamond, and killing his own wife. When police arrive on the scene, Bertuccio is accused of the murder and jailed.</p>
                    <p>Abbé Busoni testifies for Bertuccio and successfully releases him from prison. Busoni suggests that he work for the Count of Monte Cristo. While the Count and Bertuccio are looking for houses, the Count takes them to the estate of the Saint-Mérans in Auteil, driving Bertuccio to confess for his crimes. In the Count's mind, this reinforces Bertuccio's full alleigance to him.
